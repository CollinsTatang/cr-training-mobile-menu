# Code Reviewer Training Exercise: Mobile Menu

> Add mobile menu to a portfolio website

This project is part of an exercise for the code reviewer training at Microverse.

The initial code of a portfolio website is given, and a mobile menu has to be built into it.

Please note that bugs are intentional so that the students reviewing the code have things to point out.
